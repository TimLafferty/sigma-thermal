## Lessons Learned

### 1. Validation Testing Best Practices

**Approach:**
- Create realistic, complete scenarios (not just unit tests)
- Test full workflows from input to efficiency calculation
- Validate physical relationships (mass balance, thermodynamics)
- Use parametric testing for sensitivity analysis

**Benefits:**
- Found subtle issues that unit tests missed
- Increased confidence in production readiness
- Validated calculation methodology, not just individual functions

### 2. Integration Testing Patterns

**Reusable Calculator Class:**
Creating a `BoilerEfficiencyCalculator` class made integration tests:
- More maintainable
- Easier to read
- Reusable across test cases
- Closer to actual usage patterns

**Recommendation:** Use this pattern for other modules (fluids, heat transfer)

### 3. Documentation as Validation

Writing comprehensive examples for documentation:
- Forced careful thinking about user workflows
- Identified API usability issues
- Served as additional validation
- Created reusable code samples

### 4. CI/CD Early Adoption

Setting up CI/CD in Phase 3 (validation phase) was valuable:
- Caught issues immediately
- Prevented regression
- Automated quality checks
- Made future development faster

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Liquid Fuel Validation
- Uses lookup tables rather than ultimate analysis
- Slightly lower accuracy (<0.02% vs <0.01%)
- Limited to predefined fuel types
- **Mitigation:** Sufficient for industrial applications

### 2. Performance Benchmarking
- Manual testing only (no automated suite)
- No formal profiling report
- **Status:** Deferred to Phase 4

### 3. Excel Integration Testing
- No direct Excel file reading/writing tests
- VBA validation done manually
- **Status:** Not required for current scope

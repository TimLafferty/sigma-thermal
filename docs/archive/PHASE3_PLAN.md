## Integration Test Examples

### Example 1: Boiler Efficiency Calculation

    GasCompositionMass,
    hhv_mass_gas,
    lhv_mass_gas,
    poc_h2o_mass_gas,
    poc_co2_mass_gas,
    flue_gas_enthalpy
)

# Define fuel
fuel = GasCompositionMass(methane_mass=100.0)
fuel_flow = 100.0  # lb/hr

# Operating conditions
excess_air_percent = 15.0
stack_temp = 350.0  # °F
ambient_temp = 77.0  # °F

# Calculate air requirements
stoich_air = 17.24 * fuel_flow  # lb air / lb CH4
actual_air = stoich_air * (1 + excess_air_percent / 100)

# Calculate products
h2o = poc_h2o_mass_gas(fuel, fuel_flow, 0.013, actual_air)
co2 = poc_co2_mass_gas(fuel, fuel_flow)

# Calculate stack loss
h2o_fraction = h2o / (h2o + co2 + n2 + o2)
# ... (complete calculation)

# Calculate efficiency
hhv = hhv_mass_gas(fuel)
stack_loss = flue_gas_enthalpy(...) * flue_gas_flow
efficiency = (hhv * fuel_flow - stack_loss) / (hhv * fuel_flow) * 100
